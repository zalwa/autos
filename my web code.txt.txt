        <h3>Study in Germany</h3>
        <p>
          In recent years, Germany has has a surge in the number of international students studying in the country. Key factorss that have contributed to this surge are the high reputation of German universities, a strong economy and tuition-free education for all students. Currently, most German universities only require students to pay a semester fee ranging between $100 and $300. However, in an effort to reduce deficits, the state of Baden-Württemberg will reintroduce tuition fees for non-EU students in autumn of 2017. Non-EU students studying in public universities within the state will be required to pay €3,000 per year. While not a small amount, it a lot less than the $23,000 average tuition fees at state unversities in the US.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite been affordable, students who do not speak German find it hard to gather the right information especially at the undergraduate level. This is because most undergraduate degree programs are offered in German. However, students intersted in pursuing any of the over 1000 international degree programmes are not required to know German. A good resource for prospective international stuents is the <a href="https://www.study-in.de/en/">Study in Germany</a> website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the tuition free education, there are costs in studying in Germany. Key among them is the cost of living, which is higher than that in developing countries such as Kenya. International students seeking to study in Germany are therefore required to give proof of financial resources to support their study. Students are required to give proof of around €8,700 (KES 1,066,144) per year for the duration of their study. Students are allowed to give this proof in any of the following ways:
          <ul>
            <li>Your parents can submit documents certifying their income and financial assets.</li>
            <li>Someone with permanent residence in Germany can guarantee the Alien Registration Office to cover your expenses.</li>
            <li>A security payment can be deposited into a blocked account.</li>
            <li>You can present a bank guarantee.</li>
            <li>You can present a scholarship award notification from a recognised scholarship provider.</li>
          </ul>
          There are numerous scholarship opportunities for international students in Germany. You can find the various scholarships <a href="https://www.daad.de/deutschland/stipendium/datenbank/en/21148-scholarship-database/">here</a>.

        <h3>Options to study in Germany in English</h3>
        <p>
          There are alternative options. For example, the pan-European business school ESCP Europe offers the chance to study in the capital cities of three countries (London, Paris/Madrid and Berlin) on its Bachelor in Management program for €13,100 (~US$13,750) per year. ESCP Europe also offers graduate programs taught in English across all five of its European campuses (in Berlin, London, Madrid, Paris and Turin), including the Master in Management and the Master in European Business programs.
          In addition, those seeking to study in Germany for a short duration are often not required to be proficient in German.
